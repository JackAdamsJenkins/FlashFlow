# **App Name**: FlashFlow

## Core Features:

- CSV Import: Import flashcards from a CSV file with 'front' and 'back' columns. Parse the CSV data into a usable flashcard format. Assume the file has the proper headers.
- Flashcard Display: Display the current flashcard. Shows either the front or the back of the flashcard.
- Card Navigation: Provide 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons for navigating the flashcards. Implement wraparound: after the last card comes the first card again.
- Card Flip: A button or other toggleable control that allows users to flip the current card and show the front if the back is currently being shown, or vice versa.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft teal (#A0E7E5) for a calm learning environment.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Coral (#FFAEBC) for interactive elements like buttons.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for both headings and body text.
- Centered layout with generous padding to focus attention on the flashcards.
- Subtle flip animation when toggling between the front and back of a card.
